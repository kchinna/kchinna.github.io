# Portfolio Website

Hi, my name is Kanishk Chinna and this is my personal portfolio website. <br>
This is the second iteration of my portfolio website and was developed using what I learned from the development of the first site which can be found
<a href="https://kchinna.github.io/portfolio-site-v1">here</a>. <br>
This website is built using ReactJS and is a fast and intuitive way to get to know me. <br>

- The "about" section provides a little insight into who I am.
- The "projects" section shows some of the interesting things I've worked on.
- The "technical skills" section shows some of the technologies I have experience with.
- The "experiences" section shows my work experiences.
- And the footer provides links to my Github, LinkedIn, and Instagram.
